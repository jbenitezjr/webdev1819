                    Naval warfare changed dramatically during the war, with the ascent of the aircraft carrier, and the impact of increasingly capable<br>
                    submarines. Destroyers saw dramatic improvements, as the Fubuki-class destroyer set a new standard not only for Japanese vessels, but<br>
                    for navies around the world, and are considered to be the world's first modern destroyer. Submarines were critical in the Pacific<br>
                    and Atlantic theatres. Advances in submarine technology included the snorkel, though advanced German submarine types came into service<br>
                    too late to impact the war effort. The German Kriegsmarine also introduced the pocket battleship, to get around constraints imposed by<br>
                    the Treaty of Versailes.

                    Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of<br>
                    the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During<br>
                    production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed<br>
                    into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.<br>
                    Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the<br>
                    milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing,<br>
                    and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester,<br>
                    is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries.<br>
                    For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree<br>
                    by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to<br>
                    rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species<br>
                    of the Cynara thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.
