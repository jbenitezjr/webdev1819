            <h3>
                Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who<br>
                take turns batting and fielding.
            </h3>
            <div>
                The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the<br>
                opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running<br>
                counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate.<br>
                A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and touches home plate.<br>
                Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding<br>
                team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways.<br>
                A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance<br>
                to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other<br>
                means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team<br>
                records three outs.
            </div>

                <h5>
                    One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes<br>
                    an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater<br>
                    number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of<br>
                    nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock,<br>
                    although most games end in the ninth inning.
